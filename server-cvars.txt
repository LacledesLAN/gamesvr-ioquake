In order to get a basic server going and setup you will need to setup a server config file with the settings you want. The settings for any quake engine game are called console varibles or CVAR's for short. In all the example config files the cvars and functions are labeled, but I figurued its best to go over a few.  All config files are just scripts that just commands that run in the console. So pretty much every cvar and console command are interchangeable. Also you can have multiple configs on your server for any reason, just add +exec server-whatever.cfg to your command string. 

So to start off to examine a basic config file and to examine the pices. 

Basic essential cvars. 

set sv_hostname "MY QUAKE3 SERVER"         // name that appears in the server list

Host name is what you name the server its what will be listed on server browsrs and favorites list. Most of the time it should say who owns it and what kind of server it runs. A good example would be "Pierre's Q3 CTF server"


set g_motd "CHANGE ME"              // message that appears when connecting

The MOTD is just a message that shows up on startup. Typically it may show some rules or or a web address.

//set sv_privatePassword ""           // password to enter the server
//set rconpassword "changeme"         // password for remote console. For docker it is best to put this in your launch string

So sv_private password is the password you would use to prevent players from entering private matches. The rconpassword is the password to allow remote admin acces. Since this docker repository is public and all the files can be read its best to put these varibles in the launch string.   +set sv_private password "secretword" +set rconpassword "adminpassword"


set sv_maxclients 16                // max. number of clients than can connect
sv_maxPing 0	                  // set the maximum ping aloud on the server. 0 to disable.




This allows you to set the max number of players that can connect. 

set g_inactivity 120                // kick players after being inactive (in seconds)
If a player has been inactive after that many seconds they get kicked. 

set sv_pure 0                       // 1: pure server, no altered pk3 files

So players may have client side mods to change the look and appearence quake 3. Some mods are to enhance the visual quality and other mods may be made to cheat and see through walls. You would want to set this varible to 1 for a compeitive match.

set g_allowvote 1                   // allow players to vote for map changes

This will allow players to change maps and other game modes without admin intervention.


set g_log server.log                // log file name
set logfile 0                       // 0:off 1:buffered 2:continuous 3:append to existing

One part that is important to running a server is to log what happens in the server. The g_log varible is the file name of the log and how the log file is recorded is detemined by the logfile varible. 


Rules and gamemodes

Limits
set timelimit 10                    // time limit in minutes for all modes (0 for no limit)
set fraglimit 30                    // frag limit for all modes (0 for no limit)
set capturelimit 8                  // capture limit for CTF mode (0 for no limit)

A game server can be said that its an arena for the players and the refeere. These varibles empensize the "referee" aspect. These varible set limits for time on the map, score for frags, and flag captures. 


set g_teamAutoJoin 0                // 0:goes into spectator mode, 1:auto joins a team
set g_teamForceBalance 1            // 0:free selection, 1:forces player to join weak team

So when a player joins a server the payer could automatically be thrown in or join as a spectator with the options join the game and/or pick a team team (in team games). Setting g_teamAutoJoin to 0 will allow the players to choose what side to join. The varible g_teamForceBalance would force even teams and will not allow anyone to join a team if it would be lopsided. 


set g_gametype 0 //sets the game type

The gametype varible is an important varible that determines what gametype is played. 
//	0	Free for all
//	1	Tournament
//	3	Team deathmatch
//	4	Capture the Flag

The following requires the Team Arena Expansion
//	2	Free for all deathmatch 
//	5	One Flag Capture        
//	6	Overload                
//	7	Harvester        

For Quake 3 arena the two game modes that would require their own playlists are 1/Tournament and 4/Capture the flag. The capture the flag game mode just needs a CTF playlist. The tournament game mode is meant for 1v1 matches so having a play list of small maps would be best. 



set sv_allowDownload 1              // enables downloading maps from server
set sv_wwwDownload 1                // enables the http redirect
set sv_dlURL "http://www.url-to-your-files.com" // should point to the q3a folder
set sv_wwwDlDisconnected 1          // disconnects the client while downloading the files
set cl_wwwDownload 1                // connects the client again when the download is finished

If you have custom maps or any custom files, the client needs to be able to download them. To prevent a client downloading files from interfering with function and performance with the server, its best to use a webserver to host the files for download. The only varible that needs to be changed is the sc_dlURL. This feature was not original part of quake 3 arena and was added to ioquake. A good explaination of this feature can be found in the openarena wiki. https://openarena.fandom.com/wiki/Manual/Automatic_downloading



Bot Cvars
set bot_enable 0                    // allow bots on the server
set bot_nochat 1                    // 1: disable bot chatting (recommended!)
set g_spskill 4                     // default skill of bots [1-5]
set bot_minplayers 5                // fills the server with bots to satisfy the minimum



Most situations would not require bots and bots have been used too often to make a server feel more populated than it is. For testing puroposes thise commands are valuable to ensure functionality.



Commands
addbot [name] [skill] [team] [delay] // adds a bot manually example: addbot doom   4   blue    10
When it comes to the addbot command, typically you only need the name, skill, and team (only on team games) for it to work. The names pull from the bots in the singleplayer campaign, you can go into models options on the player settings to see the list. 

killserver // stop server and shutdown 
kick // kick player
status // status of currently connected server
system info // shows system info
echo "text // outputs "text" to console. Really useful at the begining of a config for logs. echo "running server-example.cfg" to let you know when the config is loded

Map changing
So due to the strange nature of how playlists are done in quake 3, you cannot use the "map" command. Using the "map" command will break the chain of commands for the playlist to work. essentially you would have to refer to the playslist file to manually to put in the right "vstr" command to change the map. 

For example under the stock dm playlist and you want to switch to brimstone abbey.

set stock-dm-8 "map q3dm8 ; set nextmap vstr stock-dm-9"        // Brimstone Abbey

you would simply put in the command "vstr stock-dm-8"
It will change the map to q3dm8 and set the next map.
